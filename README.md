[ **DEMO ME ON GLITCH!**](https://dataviz-with-react-and-d3.glitch.me)

This page contains Data Visualizations based on the [Eurovision winners Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Eurovision_Song_Contest_winners).

### What is Eurovision?

Eurovision Song Contest is an annual pop music competition where different European countries compete to win the most popular song in Europe.
It's like the olympics, but just for European pop music.

The Wikipedia entry for Eurovision winners provides a perfect database for demonstrating various techniques in data visualization.

Technologies incorporated:

- D3.js _data visualizations_
- React _Front End_
- Axios _npm package for managing HTTP requests/data fetching_
